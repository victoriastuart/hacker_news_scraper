# hacker_news_scraper

A Python 3 script for scraping the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) feed, filtering that content by

* number of points, and/or
* number of comments, and/or
* excluding posts {dead | flagged | youtube | wikipedia | ...} according to a keywords list

Run via `~/.bashrc` alias or `crontab`.

Experimental code; I will monitor it locally (scheduled to run {06:00 | 18:00} daily, starting 2020-04-14) for bugs, etc.

Sample output [hn.txt](https://github.com/victoriastuart/hacker_news_scraper/blob/master/hn.txt)
